# Units
Maximum file size in megabytes, requires numeric value.<br>
Time units:
* `i` — minutes
* `h` — hours
* `w` — weeks
* `m` — months
* `y` — years

# Config
* `listen` — IP and port to listen on in the following form: ip:port
* `uri` — Instance URI. Example: `"uri":"/art/"` -> https://skunky.ebloid.ru/art/
* `cache` — Caching system; default is off.
  * `enabled` — Caching system state, requires boolean value
  * `path` — Path to cache directory. It must be writable by the user SkunkyArt
    runs as, and SkunkyArt refuses to start if it is not. The container image
    runs as uid 10000, so a bind-mounted cache needs
    `sudo chown -R 10000:10000 <dir>` on the host.
  * `lifetime` — Cached file life time, requires numeric value, followed by multiplicative suffix (see Time Units for details)
  * `max-size` — Maximum file size in megabytes
  * `update-interval` — Automatic rotation interval
* `static-path` — This setting determines path to static, which will be copied to RAM when SkunkyArt is started. Useless if you're use binary compiled with 'embed' tag.
* `download-proxy` — Outbound proxy used when fetching media from DeviantArt's
  CDN. Leave empty (`""`) unless you actually run a proxy: if this points at
  something that isn't listening, every image 502s while pages still render,
  because only media fetches go through it. Inside a container `127.0.0.1` is
  the container itself, so a host-side proxy must be addressed by service name
  or host IP, not loopback.
* `user-agent` — String, which SkunkyArt uses as UA
* `proxy` — Serve media through this instance instead of linking straight to
  DeviantArt's CDN. Required by `cache`; when off, clients fetch images from
  wixmp directly.
* `nsfw` — Show mature content.

# Setting up reverse proxy
Pretty much business as usual, except for the [`X-Forwarded-Proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto) header setting.

Nginx example configuration:
```apache
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name skunky.example.com;
    
    # In case of subdomain, use / instend of ((BASE_URL))
    location ((BASE_URL)) {
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_pass http://((IP)):((PORT));
    }
}
```
