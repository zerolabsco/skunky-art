## Description
SkunkyArt 🦨 — an alternative frontend for DeviantArt that works entirely
without JavaScript.

## Build
It is recommended to build with the 'embed' tag because it embeds the presets in
the binary. If you plan to modify the templates, then do not use this tag. You
can also add the `-ldflags "-w -s"` argument (GCCGO has a different name for it
— `gccgoflags`) to reduce the size of the output file. Here is an example:

`go build -tags embed -ldflags "-w -s"`

## Docker
Prebuilt multi-arch images (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) are published to GHCR
on every release tag:

`docker pull ghcr.io/zerolabsco/skunky-art:latest`

Each release is tagged `1.3.3`, `1.3`, `1` and `latest`; pin an exact version if
you want reproducible upgrades. `compose.example.yaml` uses this image by
default and keeps a commented-out `build: .` for building from a checkout.
`compose.vpn_example.yml` does the same, plus an optional VPN egress sidecar.

## Setup
The sample config is in the `config.example.json` file. For custom config, use
the `--config` option.

See the [`SETUP.md`](SETUP.md) file for more info about directives.

## Adding instance to the list
To do this, you must either make a PR by adding your instance to the
`instances.json` and `INSTANCES.md` files (you can use `--add-instance`
cli-argument to automatically add the instance to these files) or create an
Issue.
